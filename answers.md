## eCommerce Sim

### Summary

Let's simulate an e-commerce site. We're going to need users, products, and orders.

- users need a name and an email.
- products need a name and a price
- orders need a ref to product.
- All 3 need primary keys.

### Instructions

- Create 3 tables following the criteria in the summary.
```sql
CREATE TABLE users(
  user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(100),
  last_name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(200)
);
CREATE TABLE products(
  product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(200),
  price DECIMAL(10,2)
);
CREATE TABLE order_line(
  order_line_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT,
  product_id INT REFERENCES products(product_id),
  quantity INT
);
CREATE TABLE orders(
  order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id),
 	order_date DATE
);
ALTER TABLE order_line
ADD CONSTRAINT fk FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders (order_id);
```
- Add some data to fill up each table.
  - At least 3 users, 3 products, 3 orders.
